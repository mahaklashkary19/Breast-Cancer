Breast Cancer Detection using CNN
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

🧠 Overview
The goal of this project is to apply a simple deep learning model to a well-known medical dataset, gaining familiarity with:

Data preprocessing and normalization

Reshaping input for 1D CNNs

Building and training a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras

Evaluating model performance
